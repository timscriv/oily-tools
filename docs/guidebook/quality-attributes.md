A list of the quality attributes (non-functional requirements; e.g. performance, scalability, security, etc).

- Performance (e.g. latency and throughput)
- Scalability (e.g. data and traffic volumes)
- Availability (e.g. uptime, downtime, scheduled maintenance, 24x7, 99.9%, etc)
- Security (e.g. authentication, authorization, data confidentiality, etc)
- Extensibility
- Auditing
- Monitoring and management
- Reliability
- Failover/disaster recovery targets (e.g. manual vs automatic, how long will it take?)
- Business continuity
- Interoperability
- Legal, compliance and regulatory requirements (e.g. data protection act)
